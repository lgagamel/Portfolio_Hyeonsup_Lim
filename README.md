## 🔧 Modeling-Focused Research

These projects demonstrate advanced modeling using Python, statistical learning, and real-world transportation data.

- [Freight Generation ML Model](modeling/freight_generation_model/)  
  Predicting industry-specific freight volumes using Random Forest and XGBoost (30% RMSE reduction).

- [Multi-Output Chaining for Time Series Forecasting of U.S. Imports/Exports](modeling/multi_output_chain_forecasting/)  
  Multi-output SARIMAX time series model to predict cascading impacts of global events, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

- [Self-Learning License Plate Matching](modeling/self-learning_license_plate_matching/)  
  Self-learning algorithm using weighted edit distance and derived association matrices to enhance license plate matching accuracy under OCR uncertainty.

- [Bayesian Data Fusion for Estimating Error Distribution](modeling/bayesian_approach_error_distribution_estimation/)  
  Self-learning Bayesian model to estimate and update GPS and distance sensor error distributions, improving vehicle position accuracy in connected environments.

- [Sequential Network Imputation (Submitted for Provisional Patent)](modeling/sequential_network_imputation/)  
  Graph-based imputation method to estimate detailed truck class volumes for >99% of links with missing data using <1% links with observed data, now part of a provisional patent.  

- [Petroleum Consumption Estimation using Circle Detection](modeling/hough_circle_detection/)  
  Combines terminal tank size (from satellite images) with Hough Circle Detection algorithm, Weighted Voronoi, and VMT data to estimate local petroleum product demand calibrated to state totals.
